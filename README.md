## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes

-   Interactive elements

-   Stripe payment form

## Technologies Used

-   HTML, CSS, Django, Bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript, Git, Github, Kanban, Canva, Cloudinary, Stripe, Google Search Console

## Testing

-   W3c HTML validator, no errors except for Django coding.
  ![W3c Validator](readme_images/w3c.jpg)
    The validator flags obsolete attributes (frameborder, allowtransparency, and scrolling) and a private browsing context name (__privateStripeMetricsControllerXXXX) in iframes generated by Stripe. These are beyond my control as they are part of Stripe's integration. My code itself adheres to modern standards and passes validation without third-party scripts.
    Also bottom warning about h1s is unneccessary as it is the top level h1 and is the only h1 element used in any page.
-   Jigsaw CSS validator no errors
  ![Jigsaw Validator](readme_images/jigsaw.jpg)

  ![Jshint Validator](readme_images/jshint.jpg)
-   CI Python Linter showed no major errors.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers. I opened every page and form and ensured all functionality was working correctly in every browser.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Large Screen Television, Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, and a range of different android and apple smartphones and it looked how I want on every device.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, all links directed to the correct area, all forms submitted correctly and items all added correctly to basket and saved for later. I did this by getting myself and other people I know to comb through the website and do everything, making sure that things like orders, contacts etc. showed up everywhere they should including admin panel.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   Checked payment on Stripe in test environment
-   Sent multiple messages back and forth and created, edited and deleted profiles.

-   Created a Facebook business profile ![Facebook Business](readme_images/fb-business.jpg)
