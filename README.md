## Testing

- **W3C HTML Validator** – No errors except for Django-specific code.  
  ![W3C Validator](readme_images/w3c.jpg)

  The validator flags obsolete attributes (`frameborder`, `allowtransparency`, and `scrolling`) and a private browsing context name (`__privateStripeMetricsControllerXXXX`) in iframes generated by Stripe. These are beyond my control as they are part of Stripe’s integration. My code itself adheres to modern standards and passes validation without third-party scripts.

  Also, the bottom warning about H1 elements is unnecessary, as it is the top-level H1 and the only H1 element used on any page.

- **Jigsaw CSS Validator** – No errors.
